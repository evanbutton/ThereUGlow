            <p>There U Glow is a rare women, trans, femme &amp; queer technical educational space. We specialize in
                helping folks with their busted glowing/technical needs. We do this by enticing folks into our orbit
                through the magic of glowing, rainbow LED lights and what it takes to run them.<br><br>There U Glow
                heavily centers and focuses on often self-described "non-technical" and traditionally marginalized
                folks. We also fight to raise technical women and queer folks up as the unparalleled experts and
                precious individuals they are, (without giving them more work to do along the way). <br><br>We teach
                people of all ages, but specifically and heavily focus on femmes and queers ages 20 and up. We know that
                we are fighting generational and cultural pipeline problems these days, not fostering technical
                interests in childhood. <br><br>We were forged in the welcoming sandbox of Oregonâ€™s regional burning man
                event, SOAK. There U Glow emerged in 2021 as a dynamic theme camp with groundbreaking purpose and has
                evolved into a very popular annual experience and open source online knowledge hub. There U Glow has
                made a significant mark on it's local Portland Oregon community and continues to integrate locally.
                Though we change shape flexibly to accommodate everything we balance, we will not stop anytime soon.
                What we do is too important.</p>
